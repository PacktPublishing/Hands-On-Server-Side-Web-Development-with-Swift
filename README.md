**Build dynamic web apps by leveraging two popular Swift web frameworks**

## What is this book about?
This book is about building professional web applications and web services using Swift 4.0 and leveraging two popular Swift web frameworks: Vapor 3.0 and Kitura 2.5. In the first part of this book, weâ€™ll focus on the creation of basic web applications from Vapor and Kitura boilerplate projects. As the web apps start out simple, more useful techniques, such as unit test development, debugging, logging, and the build and release process, will be introduced to readers.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Build simple web apps using Vapor 3.0 and Kitura 2.5
* Test, debug, build, and release server-side Swift applications
* Design routes and controllers for custom client requests
* Work with server-side template engines
* Deploy web apps to a host in the cloud
